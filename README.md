- 👋 Hi, I’m @JacquelineCampbell-USDA and I am a Plant Geneticist working for the USDA. 
- 👀 I’m interested in data manangement / organization, soybeans, gene model predictation, gene expression and anything to do with bioinformatics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning using Jekyll and Liquid to develop GitHub pages for an updated SoyBase.org. I am always expanding my knowledge about the latest research. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on oybean research involving genetics, genomics and breeding. And after the publication is released I can help get the reserach data on SoyBase.org.
